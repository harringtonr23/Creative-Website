<p> One of the most recognizable streetwear brands in the world that came from humble beginings... </p>

<p>The Jordan name comes from NBA player Michael Jordan who was in his prime during the 1980s and early 1990s. For around 10 years he was one of the best basketball players in he NBA. He was Born in Brooklyn NYC in 1963 and he quickly began to play basketball. He was drafted to the Chicago Bulls in 1984 where he quickly began to impress fans and teammates alike. The next year in 1985 the first Jordan shoe released and featured red,black,and white, the colors of      the Chicago Bulls. About every two years or so new Jordans come out like in 1986 the Jordan II came out and in 1988 the Jordan III released to the public. Nike uses these original designs but adds new styles including colors, branding etc. which keep sneakerheads addiced to the shoes. Since then Jordan shoes like the Jordan I and Jordan IV Retros have become very popular street wear and less of basketball shoes as they were originally intended. Some of these pairs can fetch hundreds if not thousands of dollars!!</p>
